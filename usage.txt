Usage:

  minmail [files]
  minmail --wreak-havok [files]

Description:

  Extract parts of RFC 822 message files, such as those found beneath
  ~/Maildir, into separate files in a subdirectory named "pieces" that
  is created if necessary in the current working directory.

  In the first form (without --wreak-havok), the original mail files
  are untouched, and the pieces subdirectory is populated.

  If --wreak-havok is given, the original mail files will be
  overwritten with "minimal" RFC 822 messages that have:

  1. no attachments

  2. no alternate parts (text/plain if available, otherwise text/html)

  3. fewer mail headers

Options:

  --wreak-havok   # modify the original mail file(s)

Examples:

  # Extract parts from a single message into pieces/ .  E.g.,
  # pieces/20210615.195257.j@example.com.01.txt
  # pieces/20210615.195257.j@example.com.02.html
  # pieces/20210615.195257.j@example.com.03.png
  minmail message.eml  # creates files in pieces, e.g.,

  # Extract parts from all mail files in a single Maildir folder named
  # "Read".
  find ~/Maildir/Read -maxdepth 2 -type f | xargs minmail

  # In addition to extracting parts, modify the original message to
  # make it minimal.
  minmail --wreak-havok message.eml
